The aim of this project is to demonstrate differences between LGBTQ+ respondents and non-LGBTQ+ respondents in their feelings of academic success, mental health, and sense of belonging within the campus environment.

Impacts
This analysis sought to quantify shared experiences between individuals who identify as members of the LGBTQ+ community in order to quantify the needs of students. Identifying the needs of underrepresented groups is a critical step to help institutions identify resources and intiatives to help improve their academic performance and mental health. Increasing availability and access to resources of underrepresented groups also benefits institutions by reducing student risk on campus, improving academic performance, and increasing student retention rates.
