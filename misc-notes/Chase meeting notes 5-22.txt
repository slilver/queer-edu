Their Thoughts:
- makes sense to have a relationship interested in
- for this project, think through who this is going to be delivered to -- one of biggest changes from academia
- now that on the other side, different perspective: producing things for a client to meet some kind of conditions agreed upon in a contract
- key idea: describe things in a way that is understandable by people who don't do data science
- hardest part of academia to industry is to convince people that have incredible array of skills that are desirable -- think explicitly about client

- when first see the project, see kitchen sink approach: what impacts that outcome via the model 
-- what is a relationship that we can demonstrate and dmeonstrate thoroughly?
-- instead of throwing in a bunch of predictors and see what sticks and what doesn't stick
-- is there a specific relationship that we can find in this data that create a data science product that can be delivered to a hypothetical client? 
- recommend dashboarding: good looking descriptive visualisation
- can get cuts of data that is quite granular on identity? 

** descriptive analysis is important **

- key things asked for in data science interviews:
-- code snippets (this exercise is useful for producing this)
-- dashboarding (so we should do some of this)
-- writing sample (not dissertation, but rather written descriptive analysis)

Recommendation: do internship

- Scrum: quick 15 minute meeting to check in daily
