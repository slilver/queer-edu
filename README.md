***Data Analysis***

LGBTQ+: Anyone whose self-identified sexual orientation is lesbian, gay, bisesxual, queer, questioning, asexual, or pansexual, or whose self-identified gender identity is transgender, genderqueer, non-binary, or two-spirit.

Non-LGBTQ+: Anyone who does not fall under the preceding definition of LGBTQ+. 

Metrics include comparison of response distributions between demographic groups of interest for different survey questions. 

Demographic groups to compare:
1) LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+
2) Gender identity groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 
3) Sexual orientation groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 
4) Race/ethnicity groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 

Survey questions fall within 3 broad categories:
1) Academic performance
2) Mental health
3) Sense of belong within the campus environment
