Data Science for Justice project as part of Erd√∂s Institute May-June 2023 data science bootcamp.

***Data Gathering***

We utilized survey data from the Healthy Minds Student Survey provided by the Healthy Minds Network upon request. Data were shared as csv files. We focused on the year 2019-2020.
Additional information and codebooks are available here: https://healthymindsnetwork.org/hms/

***Data Cleaning and Processing***

Data was cleaned and transformed in python and excel. Python files used for cleaning are located in the folder "queer-edu-python" and utilizes the columsn of interest written in "Data_of_interest_csv". Each data file was first reduced to include specific survey questions chosen by group members. These are located in the folder "reduced-csv-files". Select columns were then transformed for easier use and interpretation in Tableau. These are located in the folder "reduced-merged-files". 

***Data Visualization***

We created a set of dynamic dashboards in Tableau to visualize differences in survey responses. The dashboards are located within the folder "tableau-workbooks", but require Tableau Desktop Edition. They are also available to view on Tableau Public with a free account: https://public.tableau.com/views/DataScienceforJusticeTableauWorkbook/ReadMe?:language=en-US&:display_count=n&:origin=viz_share_link

The demographic groups to compare include sexuality and gender. 

LGBTQ+: Anyone whose self-identified sexual orientation is lesbian, gay, bisesxual, queer, questioning, asexual, and/or pansexual, or whose self-identified gender identity is transgender, genderqueer, non-binary, and/or two-spirit.

Non-LGBTQ+: Anyone who does not fall under the preceding definition of LGBTQ+. 

Metrics include comparison of response distributions between demographic groups of interest for different survey questions. 

Questions studied in the dashboard include:


Demographic groups to compare:
1) LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+
2) Gender identity groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 
3) Sexual orientation groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 

Survey questions fall within 3 broad categories:
1) Academic performance
2) Mental health
3) Sense of belonging within the campus environment
