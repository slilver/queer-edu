Queer in Academia: How does identity impact student performance and experience?

***Data Gathering***

We utilized survey data from the Healthy Minds Student Survey provided by the Healthy Minds Network upon request. Data were shared as csv files. We focused on the year 2019-2020.
Additional information and Codebook are available here: https://healthymindsnetwork.org/hms/

***Data Cleaning and Processing***
Data was cleaned and transformed in python and excel. The data file was first reduced to include specific survey questions chosen by group members. Select columns were then transformed for easier use and interpretation in Tableau.

***Data Visualization***
The demographic groups to compare include seuality and gender. 

LGBTQ+: Anyone whose self-identified sexual orientation is lesbian, gay, bisesxual, queer, questioning, asexual, or pansexual, or whose self-identified gender identity is transgender, genderqueer, non-binary, or two-spirit.

Non-LGBTQ+: Anyone who does not fall under the preceding definition of LGBTQ+. 

Metrics include comparison of response distributions between demographic groups of interest for different survey questions. 

Questions included in the dashboard include:


Demographic groups to compare:
1) LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+
2) Gender identity groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 
3) Sexual orientation groups within LGBTQ+ vs non-LGBTQ+ 

Survey questions fall within 3 broad categories:
1) Academic performance
2) Mental health
3) Sense of belong within the campus environment
